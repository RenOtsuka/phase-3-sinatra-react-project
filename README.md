# Phase 3 Project

## Overview
------------
This repository is the backend of my project, which uses Sinatra to communicate to/from the database.

## Features
------------
This repository sets up the database for a To-do list app, where the categories for each item on the list establishes a one-to-many relationship.

There is full CRUD capability on the To-do list model, while the category model has read and create capabilities.

### Frontend Setup
-------------------
The frontend is being managed in a separate repository, which uses React to display the To-do list app.
